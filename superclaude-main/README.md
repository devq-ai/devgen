🔮 **Supercharge your GitHub workflow with Claude AI.** Transform your development process with AI-powered commit messages, intelligent changelogs, automated documentation, and code reviews that actually understand your codebase.

## Quick Install

```bash
npm install -g superclaude
```

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, Git, [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), and optionally [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

## Quick Start

```bash
cd your-project
superclaude --verify        # Check system dependencies and authentication
superclaude commit          # AI generates perfect commit messages
superclaude changelog       # Creates intelligent project history
superclaude readme          # Writes comprehensive documentation
```

## Commands

### 🔧 `superclaude --verify`
**Smart dependency and authentication checking.**

Validates your system setup and authentication status with intelligent caching to avoid repeated checks. Ensures Claude, Git, and GitHub authentication are properly configured.

```bash
superclaude --verify                  # Force full dependency check
```

**How it works:**
- Validates Claude Code installation and authentication
- Checks Git configuration and user setup
- Verifies GitHub authentication (SSH keys or GitHub CLI)
- Uses intelligent 24-hour caching to avoid repeated checks
- Provides detailed feedback on any missing dependencies

### 🤖 `superclaude commit`
**AI-powered commits that actually make sense.**

Analyzes your git changes, understands the context, and generates conventional commit messages. No more "fix stuff" or "update files" - get meaningful commits that tell the story of your code.

```bash
superclaude commit                    # Quick AI commit
superclaude commit --interactive      # Review before committing  
superclaude commit --verbose          # See the AI thinking process
superclaude commit "Add user context" # Include additional context
```

**How it works:**
- Scans all changed files and understands the modifications
- Analyzes code patterns to determine commit type (feat/fix/refactor/etc.)
- Generates conventional commit format with clear descriptions
- Supports additional context to guide commit message generation
- Enhanced authentication validation for seamless push operations
- Automatically stages, commits, and pushes to your current branch

### 📅 `superclaude changelog`
**Turn raw commit history into readable project stories.**

Creates human-readable changelogs that focus on user impact, not technical noise. Generates daily, weekly, and monthly summaries that actually make sense to stakeholders.

```bash
superclaude changelog                 # Generate intelligent changelog
superclaude changelog --verbose       # See detailed analysis process
```

**How it works:**
- Analyzes entire commit history with AI understanding
- Filters out trivial changes, focuses on meaningful updates  
- Groups changes by time periods and impact
- Creates multiple changelog formats (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Writes in clear, non-technical language

### 📖 `superclaude readme`
**Professional documentation that writes itself.**

Analyzes your codebase architecture and creates comprehensive README files with installation guides, usage examples, and feature descriptions.

```bash
superclaude readme                    # Generate project README
```

**How it works:**
- Scans project structure and identifies key technologies
- Analyzes package.json and dependencies
- Understands code patterns and project purpose
- Creates professional documentation with examples
- Includes installation, usage, and contribution guides

### 🔍 `superclaude review`
**Code reviews that catch what humans miss.**

Performs deep code analysis for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and maintainability problems. Provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

```bash
superclaude review                    # Comprehensive code analysis
superclaude review --verbose          # Detailed security assessment
```

**How it works:**
- Analyzes entire codebase for patterns and anti-patterns
- Identifies security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks
- Evaluates code quality and maintainability metrics
- Provides specific, actionable improvement recommendations
- Saves detailed review to `docs/code-review.md`

### 📚 `superclaude docs`
**Technical documentation that developers actually read.**

Creates comprehensive technical guides covering architecture, components, deployment, and troubleshooting.

```bash
superclaude docs                      # Generate technical documentation
```

**How it works:**
- Maps project architecture and component relationships
- Documents data flow and system interactions
- Creates deployment and configuration guides
- Includes troubleshooting and debugging information
- Saves to `docs/technical-docs.md`

### 💡 `superclaude brainstorm`
**AI-powered feature ideation and improvement suggestions.**

Analyzes your codebase capabilities and suggests new features, optimizations, and architectural improvements.

```bash
superclaude brainstorm                # Get improvement ideas
```

**How it works:**
- Evaluates current codebase capabilities and patterns
- Identifies optimization opportunities and technical debt
- Suggests new features based on project direction
- Recommends architecture evolution strategies
- Saves ideas to `docs/ideas.md`

### 📝 `superclaude annotate`
**Add intelligent context to your entire git history.**

Analyzes every commit in your repository and adds AI-generated notes that explain what each change actually accomplished.

```bash
superclaude annotate                  # Add AI notes to all commits
superclaude annotate --verbose        # See annotation process
```

**How it works:**
- Processes each commit's diff and understands changes
- Generates detailed technical explanations
- Adds git notes with context and purpose
- Creates searchable commit history
- View with `git log --show-notes`

## Project Integration

Add to your `package.json` for team workflows:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "commit": "superclaude commit --interactive",
    "release:prep": "superclaude changelog && superclaude readme",
    "code:review": "superclaude review --verbose",
    "docs:update": "superclaude docs"
  }
}
```

## Why SuperClaude?

## Installation Details

### Prerequisites
Install these first:
```bash
# Required
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
# Then run: claude (and complete authentication)

# Recommended  
brew install gh          # GitHub CLI for enhanced workflows
gh auth login           # Authenticate with GitHub
```

**System Requirements:** Node.js 18+, Git configured with user info.

### GitHub Authentication Setup

SuperClaude uses intelligent global authentication detection that works across all your repositories. The system automatically validates your GitHub access using either SSH keys or GitHub CLI authentication:

#### 🔐 **SSH Authentication (Recommended)**
If your remote uses `git@github.com:...` format:
```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"

# Add public key to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy the output and add it at: https://github.com/settings/keys

# Test SSH connection
ssh -T git@github.com
```

#### 🌐 **HTTPS Authentication**
If your remote uses `https://github.com/...` format, you have three options:

**Option 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login  # Choose SSH when prompted
```

**Option 2: Switch to SSH**
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
```

**Option 3: Personal Access Token**
- Create token at [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- Use token as password when git prompts for credentials

> 💡 **Why SSH is Better:** SSH eliminates password prompts, is more secure, and provides seamless authentication. SuperClaude will automatically detect your setup and guide you through any authentication issues.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command not found**
```bash
npm install -g superclaude
# Ensure npm global bin is in your PATH
```

**Claude Code not authenticated**
```bash
claude
# Follow authentication prompts (Console/Pro/Enterprise)
```

**Git not configured**
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

**GitHub CLI issues (optional)**
```bash
brew install gh         # macOS recommended
gh auth login          # Authenticate with GitHub
```

### Debug Mode
Use `--verbose` for detailed output and `--verify` for dependency checking:
```bash
superclaude commit --verbose          # Shows step-by-step AI reasoning
superclaude --verify                  # Force full system verification
superclaude --verify --verbose        # Detailed dependency diagnostics
```
