# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸš¨ ABSOLUTE PRIORITY: HONESTY AND TRUTHFUL STATEMENTS ABOVE ALL ELSE

- You are 100% honest in all statements.

### CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **COMPLETE HONESTY IN ALL STATEMENTS** - You are 100% honest in all statements. No deception, no fake claims, no false progress reports.

2. **ZERO FAKE/MOCK/HARDCODED DATA** - Functions must return real results or fail appropriately. The presence of such code will immediately fail a subtask (0% completion).

3. **MANDATORY CODE VERIFICATION** - Every subtask the agent must verify the veracity of ALL code and tests will be written not only for the function of the code but that the code is verified by a second source.

4. **TRUTHFUL TEST IMPLEMENTATION** - PyTests cannot be written to pass with mock/fake/hardcoded data. Tests must verify real functionality with deliberate tests of all MCP tools and must return accurate and real results.

## Critical Files
+ .env - contains environment secrets, keys, tokens, passwords and config parameters for critical systems
+ CLAUDE.md - provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository

## Capitalize on MCP Resources

### REQUIRED MCP SERVERS - MUST BE VERIFIED ON SESSION START

**CRITICAL**: Before beginning ANY work, Claude Code MUST verify connectivity and functionality of ALL MCP servers. These servers provide essential capabilities that are REQUIRED for proper operation.

### Claude Code Tools
- **context7** - Documentation sourcing and semantic search; always use context7 to plan software, never guess the correct syntax, double check your planned code
- **filesystem**: File operations and project management
- **git**: Version control with DevQ.ai team configuration
- **fetch**: API calls and external resource access
- **memory**: Session persistence across Claude Code interactions
- **sequentialthinking**: Step-by-step problem solving

## Project Nature

This is a **PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) Framework** repository, not a traditional software project. The core concept: **"PRP = PRD + curated codebase intelligence + agent/runbook"** - designed to enable AI agents to ship production-ready code on the first pass.

### Core Architecture

#### Command-Driven System

- **28+ pre-configured Claude Code commands** in `.claude/commands/`
- Commands organized by function:
  - `PRPs/` - PRP creation and execution workflows
  - `development/` - Core development utilities (prime-core, onboarding, debug)
  - `code-quality/` - Review and refactoring commands
  - `rapid-development/experimental/` - Parallel PRP creation and hackathon tools
  - `git-operations/` - Conflict resolution and smart git operations

#### Template-Based Methodology

- **PRP Templates** in `PRPs/templates/` follow structured format with validation loops
- **Context-Rich Approach**: Every PRP must include comprehensive documentation, examples, and gotchas
- **Validation-First Design**: Each PRP contains executable validation gates (syntax, tests, integration)

#### AI Documentation Curation

- `PRPs/ai_docs/` contains curated Claude Code documentation for context injection
- `claude_md_files/` provides framework-specific CLAUDE.md examples

### Development Commands

#### Python Package Management

```bash
# This project uses UV package manager
uv venv                    # Create virtual environment
uv sync                    # Install dependencies
uv run [script]            # Run Python scripts
```

#### PRP Execution

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended for development)
uv run PRPs/scripts/prp_runner.py --prp [prp-name] --interactive

# Headless mode (for CI/CD)
uv run PRPs/scripts/prp_runner.py --prp [prp-name] --output-format json

# Streaming JSON (for real-time monitoring)
uv run PRPs/scripts/prp_runner.py --prp [prp-name] --output-format stream-json
```

#### Key Claude Commands

- `/prp-base-create` - Generate comprehensive PRPs with research
- `/prp-base-execute` - Execute PRPs against codebase
- `/prp-planning-create` - Create planning documents with diagrams
- `/prime-core` - Prime Claude with project context
- `/review-staged-unstaged` - Review git changes using PRP methodology

### Critical Success Patterns

#### The PRP Methodology

1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance

#### PRP Structure Requirements

- **Goal**: Specific end state and desires
- **Why**: Business value and user impact
- **What**: User-visible behavior and technical requirements
- **All Needed Context**: Documentation URLs, code examples, gotchas, patterns
- **Implementation Blueprint**: Pseudocode with critical details and task lists
- **Validation Loop**: Executable commands for syntax, tests, integration

#### Validation Gates (Must be Executable)

```bash
# Level 1: Syntax & Style
ruff check --fix && mypy .

# Level 2: Unit Tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Level 3: Integration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/endpoint -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{...}'
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- L Don't create minimal context prompts - context is everything
- L Don't skip validation steps - they're critical for one-pass success
- L Don't ignore the structured PRP format - it's battle-tested
- L Don't create new patterns when existing templates work
- L Don't hardcode values that should be config
- L Don't catch all exceptions - be specific

### Working with This Framework

#### When Creating PRPs

1. **Research First**: Analyze codebase patterns and external documentation
2. **Use Templates**: Start with `PRPs/templates/prp_base.md`
3. **Include Context**: Add URLs, code examples, gotchas, and patterns
4. **Validate Early**: Include executable validation commands
5. **Score Confidence**: Rate PRP 1-10 for one-pass implementation success

#### When Executing PRPs

1. **Load PRP**: Read and understand all context and requirements
2. **ULTRATHINK**: Create comprehensive plan, break down into todos
3. **Execute**: Implement following the blueprint
4. **Validate**: Run each validation command, fix failures
5. **Complete**: Ensure all checklist items done

#### Command Usage

- Access via `/` prefix in Claude Code
- Commands are self-documenting with argument placeholders
- Use parallel creation commands for rapid development
- Leverage existing review and refactoring commands

### Project Structure Understanding

 claude_md_files/        # Framework-specific CLAUDE.md examples
 pyproject.toml         # Python package configuration
```

Remember: This framework is about **one-pass implementation success through comprehensive context**. Every PRP should contain enough context for an AI agent to implement working code without additional research.

## Core Principles

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This principle enables flexibility and testability.

Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Design your systems so that new functionality can be added with minimal changes to existing code.

### File Tree

DevQ.ai is a monorepo with several key python apps (agentical, machina, ptolemies) each one with a CLI in Go, and authenticaion managed with zero knowledge proof STARK, also a Go app. This is the planned file tree:

### ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Functions should be short and focused sub 50 lines of code** and have a single responsibility.
- **Classes should be short and focused sub 50 lines of code** and have a single responsibility.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.

### ðŸ“Ž Style & Conventions
- **Use Python** as the primary language.
- **Follow PEP8**, always use type hints, and format with `ruff`.
- **Use `pydanticv2` for data validation**.
- **ALWAYS use classes, data types, data models, for typesafety and verifiability**
- **ALWAYS use docstrings for every function** using the Google style

### Code Formatting
- **Backend**: 88 character line length, Black formatter
- **Frontend**: 100 character line length, single quotes, required semicolons
- **Python**: 3.12, Black formatter, Google-style docstrings
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, ES2022 target

### Behavioural Guidelines

- Always use `uv` for package management.
- Always use `ruff` for linting.

- *** NEVER ASSUME OR GUESS ***
- When in doubt, ask for clarification or ask for help. more often than not youcan do websearch to find relevant examples of check ai_docs/ for examples that the user have added. 

- **Always confirm file paths & module names** exist before using them.

- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

- **KEEP README.md UPDATED**
- Whenever you make changes to the codebase, update the README.md file to reflect the changes. Espeially if you add configuration changes or new features.

- **ALWAYS keep CLAUDE.md UPDATED**
- Add new dependencies to CLAUDE.md
- Add important types and patterns to CLAUDE.md
