# Workflow Architecture Redesign

## Current Status: Design Complete, Implementation Pending

### Executive Summary
We have completed the design phase for a simplified workflow architecture that reduces complexity from 11+ workflow types to a mathematically elegant 2×2 model with infinite expressiveness through bitwise composition.

---

## 🎯 New Architecture Design

### Core Principle: Mathematical Simplicity
**2 Patterns × 2 Conditions × Bitwise Operators = Infinite Variations**

### 1. Workflow Patterns (2 Types)
```
SEQUENTIAL: 1 route with N steps (linear execution)
MAPPED:     1→K routes with Nₖ steps per route (parallel/branching)
```

### 2. Condition Types (2 Types)
```
FEEDBACK (subjective):  boolean evaluation by same-agent, other-agent, or human
OBJECTIVE (objective):  boolean evaluation via mathematical expression (X ><= Y in T time)
```

### 3. Bitwise Composition
```
&  AND     - Both conditions must be true
|  OR      - Either condition can be true  
^  XOR     - Exactly one condition must be true
~  NOT     - Inverse logic
() Parentheses - Explicit precedence
```

### 4. Complete Model
```python
@dataclass
class WorkflowDefinition:
    pattern: WorkflowPattern  # SEQUENTIAL or MAPPED
    condition: Optional[Union[FeedbackCondition, ObjectiveCondition, ConditionExpression]] = None
    config: dict = None
    name: str = ""
    description: str = ""
```

## 🗺️ Migration Mapping

### Current Complex System → New Simple Model

| Current Workflow Type | New Model Equivalent |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| `sequential` | `WorkflowPattern.SEQUENTIAL` |
| `parallel` | `WorkflowPattern.MAPPED` (1→K routes) |
| `conditional` | `SEQUENTIAL/MAPPED + ObjectiveCondition` |
| `loop` | `SEQUENTIAL + ObjectiveCondition("iteration < N")` |
| `pipeline` | `SEQUENTIAL + config={"data_flow": "transform"}` |
| `agent_feedback` | `SEQUENTIAL/MAPPED + FeedbackCondition("other-agent")` |
| `handoff` | `MAPPED + FeedbackCondition("other-agent")` |
| `human_loop` | `SEQUENTIAL/MAPPED + FeedbackCondition("human")` |
| `self_feedback` | `SEQUENTIAL/MAPPED + FeedbackCondition("same-agent")` |
| `versus` | `MAPPED + ObjectiveCondition` (competitive eval) |
| `custom` | **REMOVED** (dead code, no implementation) |

### Business Categories → Playbook Metadata
```
❌ Remove as workflow types:
   - DATA_PROCESSING, CONTENT_GENERATION, CI_CD, CODE_REVIEW, etc.
   
✅ Move to playbook categories/tags:
   - These are business domains, not execution patterns
```

### Step Types → Simplified
```
❌ Remove redundant step types:
   - LOOP, PARALLEL (duplicate workflow patterns)
   - AGENT_TASK, TOOL_EXECUTION (implementation details)
   
✅ Keep only:
   - Execution units (agent tasks that can use tools)
   - Workflow patterns handle the rest
```

## 📋 Playbook Architecture (5 Requirements)

### Clean Separation: Workflows vs Playbooks
- **Workflows** = execution patterns (how to run)
- **Playbooks** = business processes (what to achieve)

### Playbook Model
```python
@dataclass 
class Playbook:
    objective: str              # 1. Clearly defined objective
    steps: List[PlaybookStep]   # 2. Precise steps to achieve objective  
    agents: List[str]           # 3. One or more agents to complete steps
    tools: List[str]            # 4. Tools required to complete steps
    # workflows embedded in steps # 5. Workflows describe how agents behave
```
